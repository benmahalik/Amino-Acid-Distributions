# Amino-Acid-Distributions
This repo contains code, in R, for creating a data frame of the distribution of amino acids of various types of foods including: beef, egg, collagen, soy, and whey.

I did this because I could not easily find a source that had all of the information that I wanted in one place. 

While the code runs perfectly fine,it retains some mistakes I made early on, and then corrected further down in the script. I left it this way because part of my intention is to demonstrate the various things I can do with R, such as recoding and imputing values.

The output so far  is just a data frame, but eventually in the next day or so I will be adding graphs and other visuals to it.
